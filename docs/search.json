    "text": "Welcome! I am an Associate Professor (tenure-track) at International Institute of Finance, School of Management, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I received my Ph.D. degree from Florida State University (FSU) in 2022 under the supervision of Professor Xin Henry Zhang and Professor Qing Mai. I received my B.S. degree from USTC in 2017.\nMy research interests mainly cover dimension reduction, high-dimensional statistics, and tensor data analysis. I am also interested in applications in other fields, e.g., medical science, finance, etc. Recently, I am working on the robust dimension reduction of the high-dimensional heavy-tailed data, and the second-moment based sparse SDR method.\nHere is my full CV.\n\n\nEducation\n\n2017/08–2022/05: Ph.D. in Statistics, Florida State University.\n2013/08–2017/06: B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Science and Technology of China.\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n2022/07–Present: Associate Professor (tenure-track), International Institute of Finance, School of Management, University of Science and Technology of China.\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\nApplications in medical science\nDimension reduction\nHigh-dimensional statistics\nMachine learning\nRobust statistics\nTensor data analysis\n\n\n\n\nServices\n\nReviewer: Biometrics, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, Statistica Sinica, WIREs Computational Statistics.\n\n\n\n\nContact\nOffice 406, Building 1, International Institute of Finance\nHefei, Anhui, China\nEmail: zengjxl[AT]ustc[DOT]edu[DOT]cn"
