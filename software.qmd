#### TRES (Tensor Regression with Envelope Structure) ![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/TRES?color=green)

*Summary:* Provides three estimators for tensor response regression (TRR) and tensor predictor regression (TPR) models with tensor envelope structure. The three types of estimation approaches are generic and can be applied to any envelope estimation problems.
