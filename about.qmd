------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome! I am an Associate Professor (tenure-track) at International Institute of Finance, School of Management, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I received my Ph.D. degree from Florida State University (FSU) in 2022 under the supervision of Professor Xin Henry Zhang and Professor Qing Mai. I received my B.S. degree from USTC in 2017.

My research interests mainly cover dimension reduction, high-dimensional statistics, and tensor data analysis. I am also interested in applications in other fields, e.g., medical science, finance, etc. Recently, I am working on the robust dimension reduction of the high-dimensional heavy-tailed data, and the second-moment based sparse SDR method.

Here is my full [CV](CV/CV.pdf).
